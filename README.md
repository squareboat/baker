## Install

### Install via composer

```
$ composer require squareboat/baker
```

### Configure Laravel

> If you are using __laravel 5.5__ or higher then you should skip this step.

If you are using laravel 5.4 or 5.3, simply add the service provider to your project's `config/app.php` file:

#### Service Provider
```
SquareBoat\Baker\BakerServiceProvider::class,
```

## Usage

`php artisan bake Order`

This is will create the following files - 

A model at `app/Models/Order.php`.

A Repository Contract at `app/Repositories/Contracts/OrderRepository.php`.

A Repository at `app/Repositories/Database/OrderRepository.php`.

A Validator at `app/Validators/OrderValidator.php`.

A Service at `app/Services/OrderService.php`.

A Controller at `app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php`.

### You can also use the options

1. Bake with a different name

`--repository="MyOrder"` to make a service with the name **MyOrderRepository**

`--validator="MyOrder"` to make a service with the name **MyOrderValidator**

`--service="MyOrder"` to make a service with the name **MyOrderService**

`--controller="MyOrder"` to make a service with the name **MyOrderController**

2. Avoid baking of some classes

`--no-repository` to not bake repository along with the model

`--no-validator` to not bake validator along with the model

`--no-service` to not bake service along with the model

`--no-controller` to not bake controller along with the model
